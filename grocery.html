      <h2>1.Shop Locally</h2>
         <p>Buying seasonal produce ensures you get the freshest and most flavorful ingredients. Seasonal fruits and vegetables
            are often more affordable and packed with nutrients.</p>

        <h2>2.Buy in Small Quantities</h2>
          <p>Fresh groceries have a shorter shelf life, so it’s best to buy in small quantities that  you can use within a week. 
         This helps avoid waste and ensures you're eating the freshest ingredients</p>

    <h2>3.Choose organic when possible</h2>
    <p>
     Organic fruits and vegetables are grown without synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can benefit both your health 
     and the environment. While organic can be more expensive, you can prioritize buying organic for the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list—produce most likely to carry pesticide residue</p>

        <h2>4.Consider Farmers Markets</h2>
          <p>Shopping at farmers markets not only supports local farmers but also guarantees you get fresh, often organic, and seasonal produce. Farmers markets often
             offer a wider variety of less common fruits and vegetables. </p>
             <h2>5.Choose Whole Grains Over Processed Grains</h2>
             <p>Organic fruits and vegetables are grown without synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can benefit both your health and the environment. </p>
