      <h3>Eating is one of the quickest ways to comfort ourselves – food can calm,  energise and nourish us, after all. And while most people occasionally turn  to sweet, salty or fatty treats for a quick hit of comfort, such foods are often low in nutrients and can often leave us wanting more.

      <h2> 1. Opt for nutrient dense foods</h2>
      <article class="content">
        <p>Notice how certain foods always leave you wanting more? A doughnut for example, is high in calories, but contains hardly any nutrients. It’s also </p> <p>high in sugar and fat which leads to a quick high after eating, as your  body is flooded with a dose of simple carbohydrates that shoot glucose</p>
        <p>into your bloodstream. Your pancreas responds by releasing insulin to  deal with the excess glucose in your blood. Then, when your blood sugar</p> <p>returns to normal, you may be left feeling drained and low, possibly wanting  more sweet, salty or fatty snacks.</p>
        <p>This cycle may provide quick comfort, but it isn’t giving your body the essential nutrients it needs to
          stay healthy.</p> <p>Instead you should choose foods that are rich  sources of nutrients without being high in fat or calories. These are usually more  filling than processed foods,keeping you satisfied for longer in between meals.</p>

        <h4>Examples of nutrient-dense foods include:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Fruits – apples, pears, citrus fruits and berries</li>
        <li>Beans and legumes – kidney beans, lentils and chickpeas</li>

      <h2>2. Eat for immunity</h2>    
        <p>Now, more than ever, it’s important to make healthy food choices that  can support your immune system. Recent research shows that you  should aim to eat at least 30 different plant foods a week to support  good health and immunity. Key nutrients for healthy immune function  include, vitamins A, C, D, Zinc and selenium.</p>
      <h2>3. Choose foods that help your brain make the pleasure chemical</h2>
        <p> If you’re feeling stressed, worried or bored, it’s easy to turn to food as a source  of comfort. Dopamine is one of the brain’s chemical neurotransmitters  that stimulates the reward center of the brain, creating a pleasurable sensation. If dopamine is low, you may be more likely to comfort eat. To make dopamine, you need to eat foods that contain the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. Foods rich in these amino acids include proteins such as meat, fish and poultry as well as dried seaweeds, cheese, apples, bananas, blueberries, grapes , oranges, papaya, strawberries, prunes and watermelon. Vegetables, nuts and seeds also  help with dopamine production.</p>

        <h2> 4. Limit salt</h2>
        <p>Ingesting too much salt can be harmful to your health. Too much salt can affect bone health, make  muscles weak and lead to high blood pressure and water retention. The World Health Organization (WHO)  recommends  no more than 5g (one teaspoon) of salt a day and this includes ‘hidden’ salt in foods such as crisps, sauces, ready meals and canned foods. Keep your salt intake to a minimum by reading nutrition labels  and rinsing canned vegetables and beans (these contain added sodium). Instead of salt, season food with herbs
          and spices  such as black pepper, turmeric, oregano, basil, parsley and coriander. Sometimes adding lemon to  a food can also take away the need for salt.</p>
      
        <h2>5. Replace habitual sugary treats</h2>
        <p>Excess sugar can lead to obesity, tooth decay and inflammation and the WHO recommends sugar make up no more than 5 per cent (or 6 teaspoons) of your daily calorie intake. This includes honey, fruit juices and hidden  sugars found in foods such as ready-made sauces, ready meals and syrups. To minimize sugar intake read food   labels. Try to opt for foods that contain 5g or less of sugar per 100g. If you love dessert, try replacing it with fresh  fruit and cutting down to one delicious dessert a week. Instead of having fruit juice and soft drinks everyday, try  sparkling mineral water with freshly squeezed lemon or lime.</p>
